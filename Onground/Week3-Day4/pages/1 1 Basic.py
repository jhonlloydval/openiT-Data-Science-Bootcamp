# Activity 1: What does the response look like? Can you find the content of the assistant's reply in the response? make it so that the st.write() only shows the assistant's reply, not the entire response object.
# Activity 2: Add a system prompt that tells the assistant to be a cat that says meow, or a pirate that say Arrg. How does that change the response?
